      "message": "Rewrite how commands from GUI are read\n\nInstead of polling for input use a dedicated listener\nthread to read commands from the GUI independently\nfrom other threads.\n\nTo do this properly we have to delegate to the listener\nall the reading from the GUI: while searching but also\nwhile waiting for a command, like in std::getline().\n\nSo we have two possible behaviours: in-sync mode, in which\nthe thread mimics std::getline() and the caller blocks until\nsomething is read from GUI, and async mode where the listener\ncontinuously reads and processes GUI commands while other\nthreads are searching.\n\nNo functional change.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
