In our testing, Stockfish 15 is ahead of\nStockfish 14 by 36 Elo points and wins nine times more game pairs than it\nloses[1].\n\nImprovements to the engine have made it possible for Stockfish to end up\nvictorious in tournaments at all sorts of time controls ranging from bullet to\nclassical and even at Fischer random chess[2]. At CCC, Stockfish won all of\nthe latest tournaments: CCC 16 Bullet, Blitz and Rapid, CCC 960 championship,\nand the CCC 17 Rapid. At TCEC, Stockfish won the Season 21, Cup 9, FRC 4 and\nin the current Season 22 superfinal, at the time of writing, has won 16 game\npairs and not yet lost a single one.\n\nThis progress is the result of a dedicated team of developers that comes up\nwith new ideas and improvements. For Stockfish 15, we tested nearly 13000\ndifferent changes and retained the best 200. These include the fourth\ngeneration of our NNUE network architecture, as well as various search\nimprovements. To perform these tests, contributors provide CPU time for\ntesting, and in the last year, they have collectively played roughly a\nbillion chess games. In the last few years, our distributed testing\nframework, Fishtest, has been operated superbly and has been developed and\nimproved extensively. This work by Pasquale Pigazzini, Tom Vijlbrief, Michel\nVan den Bergh, and various other developers[3] is an essential part of the\nsuccess of the Stockfish project.\n\nIndeed, the Stockfish project builds on a thriving community of enthusiasts\nto offer a free and open-source chess engine that is robust, widely\navailable, and very strong. We invite our chess fans to join the Fishtest\ntesting framework and programmers to contribute to the project[4].\n\nThe Stockfish team\n\n[1] https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/625d156dff677a888877d1be\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess)#Competition_results\n[3] https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/blob/master/AUTHORS\n[4] https://stockfishchess.org/get-involved/\n",
