This can be dangerous\nso fix by copying also the StateInfo record inside\nthe new Position object and let the new st pointer\npoint to it. This completely detach the copied\nPosition from the original one.\n\nAlso rename setStartState() as saveState() and clean up\nthe API to state more clearly what the function does.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
