We lose a little bit of type safety by making Depth\nan integer, but in return we simplify the code in search.cpp quite significantly.\n\nNo functional change\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe argument favoring eliminating ONE_PLY:\n\n* The term “ONE_PLY” comes up in a lot of forum posts (474 to date)\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/fishcooking/ONE_PLY%7Csort:relevance\n\n* There is occasionally a commit that breaks invariance of the code\nwith respect to ONE_PLY\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/fishcooking/ONE_PLY%7Csort:date/fishcooking/ZIPdYj6k0fk/KdNGcPWeBgAJ\n\n* To prevent such commits, there is a Travis CI hack that doubles ONE_PLY\nand rechecks bench\n\n* Sustaining ONE_PLY has, alas, not resulted in any improvements to the\n  engine, despite many individuals testing many experiments over 5 years.\n\nThe strongest argument in favor of preserving ONE_PLY comes from @locutus:\n“If we use par example ONE_PLY=256 the parameter space is increases by the\nfactor 256. So it seems very unlikely that the optimal setting is in the\nsubspace of ONE_PLY=1.”\n\nThere is a strong theoretical impediment to fractional depth systems: the\ntransposition table uses depth to determine when a stored result is good\nenough to supply an answer for a current search. If you have fractional\ndepths, then different pathways to the position can be at fractionally\ndifferent depths.\n\nIn the end, there are three separate times when a proposal to remove ONE_PLY\nwas defeated by the suggestion to “give it a few more months.” So… it seems\nlike time to remove this distraction from the community.\n\nSee the pull request here:\nhttps://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/2289\n",

      "message": "Extend castling independently of singular extension\n\nA curious feature of Stockfish's current extension code is its repeated\nuse of \"else if.\" In most cases, this makes no functional difference,\nbecause no more than one extension is applied; once one extension has\nbeen applied, the remaining ones can be safely ignored.\n\nHowever, if most singular extension search conditions are true, except\n\"value < singularBeta\", no non-singular extensions (e.g., castling) can\nbe performed!\n\nThree tests were submitted, for three of Stockfish's four non-singular\nextensions. I excluded the shuffle extension, because historically there\nhave been concerns about the fragility of its conditions, and I did not\nwant to risk causing any serious search problems.\n\n- Modifying the passed pawn extension appeared roughly neutral at STC. At\nbest, it appeared to be an improvement of less than 1 Elo.\n- Modifying check extension performed very poorly at STC\n- Modifying castling extension (this patch) produced a long \"yellow\" run\n at STC (insufficient to pass, but positive score) and a strong LTC.\n\nIn simple terms, prior to this patch castling extension was occasionally\nnot applied during search--on castling moves. The effect of this patch is\nto perform castling extension on more castling moves. It does so without\nadding any code complexity, simply by replacing an \"else if\" with \"if\" and\nreordering some existing code.\n\nSTC:\nLLR: -2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,4.00]\nTotal: 108114 W: 23877 L: 23615 D: 60622\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5d8d86bd0ebc590f3beb0c88\n\nLTC:\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,4.00]\nTotal: 20862 W: 3517 L: 3298 D: 14047\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5d8d99cd0ebc590f3beb1899\n\nBench: 3728191\n\n--------\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\n- It seems strange to me that check extension performed so poorly -- clearly\nsome of the singular extension conditions are also very important for check\nextension. I am not an expert in search, and I do not have any intuition\nabout which of the eight conditions is/are the culprit. I will try a\nsuccession of eight STC tests to identify the relevant conditions, then try\nto replicate this PR for check extension.\n\n- Recent tests interacting with the castle extension may deserve retesting.\nI will shortly resubmit a few of my recent castling extension tweaks, rebased\non this PR/commit.\n\nMy deepest thanks to @noobpwnftw for the extraordinary CPU donation, and to\nall our other fishtest volunteers, who made it possible for a speculative LTC\nto pass in 70 minutes!\n\nCloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/2331\n",

To fix this an extra thread uithread was created,\npresumably to avoid an overlap with Threads.main() that was causing problems.\nMaking this eval request seems to be outside the scope of UCI, and @vondele also\nreports that the data race is not even fixed reliably by this change. I suggest\nwe simplify the threading here by removing this uithread and adding a comment\nsignaling that user should not request eval when a search is already running.\n\nCloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/2310\n\nNo functional change.\n",
