It\nmeans that given a skill we have same play level on a mobile\nphone and on a super OCTAL CPU, at 1' per game or at 180'.\n\nAt skill 9 strength is that of an average engine, I have used\nCrafty 20.14 to tune and we are more or less there. At skill 0\nengine is pretty weak but still shows a realistic play.\n\nWhen skill is not used we don't have any impact on the regular\ncode.\n\nIdea to use MultiPV is from Heinz van Saanen, implementation and\nformulas by me.\n\nNo functional change.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
