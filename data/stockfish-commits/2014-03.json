The problem is\nthat, for instance, in the first assignment:\n\no[\"Write Debug Log\"] = Option(false, on_logger);\n\nOptions.size() can value 0 or 1 according if the l-value (that\nincrements the size) has been evaluated after or before the\nr-value (that uses the size value).\n\nThe culprit is that assignment operator in C++ is not a\nsequence point:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_point\n\n(Note: to be nitpick here we actually use std::map::operator=()\n that being a function can evaluate its arguments in any order)\n\nSo there is no guarantee on what term is evaluated first and\nbehavior is undefined by standard in this case. The net result\nis that in case r-value is evaluated after l-value the last\nidx is not size() - 1, but size() and in the printing loop\nwe miss the last option!\n\nBug was there since ages but only recently has been exposed by\nthe removal of UCI_Analyze option so that the last one becomes\nUCI_Chess960 and when it is missing engine cannot play anymore\nChess960.\n\nThe fix is trivial (although a bit hacky): just increase the\nlast loop index.\n\nReported by Eric Mullins that found it on an ARM and MIPS\nplatforms with gcc 4.7\n\nNo functional change.\n",
