      "message": "Candidate Passed Pawn\n\nInclude some not fully supported levers in the (candidate) passed pawns\nbitboard, if otherwise unblocked. Maybe levers are usually very short\nlived, and some inaccuracy in the lever balance for the definition of\ncandidate passed pawns just triggers a deeper search.\n\nHere is a example of a case where the patch has an effect on the definition\nof candidate passers: White c5/e5 pawns, against Black d6 pawn. Let's say\nwe want to test if e5 is a candidate passer. The previous master looks\nonly at files d, e and f (which is already very good) and reject e5 as\na candidate. However, the lever d6 is challenged by 2 pawns, so it should\nnot fully count. Indirectly, this patch will view such case (and a few more)\nto be scored as candidates.\n\nSTC\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5abcd55d0ebc5902926cf1e1\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,4.00]\nTotal: 16492 W: 3419 L: 3198 D: 9875\n\nLTC\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5abce1360ebc5902926cf1e6\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,4.00]\nTotal: 21156 W: 3201 L: 2990 D: 14965\n\nThis was inspired by this test of Jerry Donald Watson, except the case of\nzero supporting pawns against two levers is excluded, and it seems that\nnot excluding that case is bad, while excluding is it beneficial.

Some strong\n> engines don't even call the eval at all nodes. Now the whole point of\n> the qsearch is to find quiet positions where captures do not change the\n> evaluation of the position with regards to the search bounds - i.e. if\n> there were good captures they would be tried.* So when a candidate lever\n> appears in the evaluation at the end of the qsearch, the qsearch has\n> guaranteed that it cannot just be captured, or if it can, this does not\n> take the score past the search bounds. Practically this may mean that\n> the side with the candidate lever has the turn, or perhaps the stopping\n> lever pawn is pinned, or that side is forced for other reasons to make\n> some other move (e.g. d6 can only take one of the pawns in the example\n> above).\n>\n> Hence granting the full score for only one lever defender makes some\n> sense, at least, to me.\n>\n> IMO this is also why huge bonuses for possible captures in the evaluation\n> (e.g. threat on queen and our turn), etc. don't tend to work.
