For example, the obvious way\nto implement memcpy() is by copying from the first byte to the last.\nHowever, the optimisation guides of some architectures recommend copying\nfrom the last byte down to the first. Also, some implementations of\nmemcpy() zero 'dst' before copying, because zeroing the destination's\ncache line(s) can improve performance.\n\nIn addition, for many of these functions, the POSIX standards have wording\nalong the lines \"If copying takes place between objects that overlap,\nthe behavior is undefined.\" Hence overlapping copies violate the standard.\n\nThe moral of the story is: if you want to write truly portable code, don't\nmake any assumptions about the language implementation.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
