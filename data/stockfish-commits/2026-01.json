      "message": "Stockfish 18\n\nOfficial release version of Stockfish 18\n\nBench: 2050811\n\n---\n\nStockfish 18\n\nToday, we have the pleasure of announcing Stockfish 18, a new major release. As\nalways, you can freely download it at [stockfishchess.org/download][1] and use\nit as a drop-in replacement in the [GUI of your choice][2] to benefit from\nstronger play and more accurate analysis.\n\nWhether you can spare hours or days of CPU time, your help matters for the\nongoing development of Stockfish. Find out how you can help at\n[stockfishchess.org/get-involved][3]. Join our [Discord server][4] to get in\ntouch with the community of developers and users of the project!\n\nQuality of chess play\n\nIn tests against Stockfish 17, this new release brings an Elo gain of up to [46\npoints][5], and wins [four times as many game pairs][6] as it loses. Quality\nimproved throughout, including in [Fischer Random Chess][7].\n\nStockfish is stronger than any human, even when running on older or low-end\nhardware. On the highest-end hardware, where Stockfish can search over [500\nmillion positions per second][8], it continues to [dominate chess engine\ntournaments][9].\n\nUpdate highlights\n\nNext-Generation Evaluation\n\nThis release introduces the SFNNv10 network architecture. The network’s input\nlayer has been augmented with 'Threat Inputs' features as part of a massive\ncommunity effort. These features allow the engine to 'see' which pieces are\nthreatened more naturally, resulting in more accurate evaluations.\n\nHardware and Performance Optimizations\n\nA key highlight is the new 'Shared Memory' implementation, which allows\ndifferent Stockfish processes to share the same memory space for neural network\nweights. This makes it the most efficient version for cloud analysis and\nhigh-concurrency testing.\n\nSignificant efforts have also been made to utilize hardware more effectively by\nadapting the code to make use of modern CPU instructions and refining how\nthreads interact during a search.\n\nSearch Improvements\n\nStockfish 18 features a heavily refined search, utilizing 'Correction History'\nto dynamically adjust evaluations based on patterns found during the search\nitself. These and other refinements allow the engine to detect stalemates and\nevaluate fortresses significantly better than previous versions. A particularly\nrare issue, involving threefold repetition detection, en passant, and pins, was\nalso fixed.\n\nRefactored Training Workflow\n\nThe training of Stockfish's neural networks has transitioned to an automated\nand reproducible model. This new framework allows the project to employ\nstandardized recipes to chain complex training stages together. This transition\nfacilitates the training of networks using over 100 billion positions of [Lc0\nevaluation data][10].\n\nThank you\n\nIn this release in particular, we are deeply grateful to the contributors who\nshared their research and ideas to help develop the new threat-input network\narchitecture.\n\nThe Stockfish project builds on a thriving community of enthusiasts (thanks to\neverybody!) who contribute their expertise, time, and resources to build a free\nand open-source chess engine that is robust, widely available, and very strong.\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude for the [14.6k stars][11] that light up\nour GitHub project. Thank you for your support and encouragement – your\nrecognition means a lot to us.

      "message": "Make shared history allocation aware of non-uniform cache access\n\nAlthough shared history has been successful overall, it led to some speed\nissues with large numbers of threads. Originally we just split by NUMA node,\nbut on systems with non-unified L3 caches (most AMD workstation and server\nCPUs, and some Intel E-core based server CPUs), this can still lead to a speed\npenalty at the default config. Thus, we decided to further subdivide the shared\nhistory based on the L3 cache structure.\n\nBased on this test, the original SPRTs, and speed experiments, we decided that\ngrouping L3 domains to reach 32 threads per SharedHistories was a reasonable\nbalance for affected systems – but we may revisit this in the future. See the\nPR for full details.\n\nIn an extreme case, a single-socket EPYC 9755 configured with 1 numa domain per socket,\nthe nps increases from:\nNodes/second               : 182827480\nto\nNodes/second               : 229118365\n\nIn many cases, when L3 caches are shared between many threads, or when several\nnuma nodes are already configured per socket, this patch does not influence the\ndefault. This default setting can adjusted with the existing NumaPolicy option.\n\ncloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/6526\n\nNo functional change.\n",
