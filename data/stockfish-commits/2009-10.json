This gives a good speed up\nespecially now that we SEE-test all the evasions that\nare always legal and very often are king moves.\n\nAnother optimization catches almost 15% of cases, unfortunatly\nwe have already calculated the very expensive attacks, so\nbenefits are not so big anyway.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
