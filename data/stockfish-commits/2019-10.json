Generally, SF tries to display only\nproven mate scores, so this is a bug.\n\nThis was posted http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=72166\nby Uri Blass, with the correct analysis that this must be related to the\n50 moves draw rule being ignored somewhere.\n\nIndeed, this is possible as positions and there eval are stored in the TT,\nwithout reference to the 50mr counter. Depending on the search path followed\na position can thus be mate or draw in the TT (GHI or Graph history interaction).\nTherefore, to prove mate lines, the TT content has to be used with care. Rather\nthan ignoring TT content in general or for mate scores (which impact search or\nmate finding), it is possible to be more selective. In particular, @WOnder93\nsuggested to only ignore the TT if the 50mr draw ply is closer than the mate\nply. This patch implements this idea, by clamping the eval in the TT to\n+-VALUE_MATED_IN_MAX_PLY. This retains the TTmove, but causes a research of\nthese lines (with the current 50mr counter) as needed.\n\nThis patch hardly ever affects search (as indicated by the unchanged\nbench), but fixes the testcase. As the conditions are very specific,\nalso mate finding will almost never be less efficient (testing welcome).\n\nIt was also shown to pass STC and LTC non-regression testing, in a form\nusing if/then/else instead of ternary operators:\n\nSTC:\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 93605 W: 15346 L: 15340 D: 62919\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5db45bb00ebc5908127538d4\n\nLTC:\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 33873 W: 7359 L: 7261 D: 19253\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5db4c8940ebc5902d6b146fc\n\ncloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/issues/2370\n\nBench: 4362323\n",
