In PV nodes, the final value returned is adjusted to reflect that the position is a TB win (or loss).\n\n\n\nThe patch also fixes a potential problem caused by root_probe() and root_probe_wdl() dirtying the root-move scores.\n\n\n\nThis patch removes the limitation of current master that a mate is never found if the root position is not yet in the TBs, but the path to mate at some point enters the TBs. The patch is intended to preserve the efficiency and effectiveness of the current TB probing approach.\n\n\n\nNo functional change (withouth TB)\n",

A couple of SPRT[-3..1]\ntests were done to bisect this value:\n\nContempt 10: http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a5d42d20ebc5902977e2901 (PASSED)\nContempt 15: http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a5d41740ebc5902977e28fa (PASSED)\nContempt 20: http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a5d42060ebc5902977e28fc (PASSED)\nContempt 25: http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a5d433f0ebc5902977e2904 (FAILED)\n\nSurprisingly, a test at \"very long time control\" hinted that using\ncontempt 20 is not only be non-regressive against contempt 0, but\nmay actually exhibit some small Elo gain, giving a likehood of superio-\nrity of 88.7% after 8500 games:\n\nVLTC:\nELO: 2.28 +-3.7 (95%) LOS: 88.7%\nTotal: 8521 W: 1096 L: 1040 D: 6385\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a60b2820ebc590297b9b7e0\n\nFinally, there was some concerns that a contempt value of 20 would\nbe worse than a value of 7, but a test with 20000 games at STC was\nneutral:\n\nSTC:\nELO: 0.45 +-3.1 (95%) LOS: 61.2%\nTotal: 20000 W: 4222 L: 4196 D: 11582\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a64d2fd0ebc590297903868\n\nSee the comments in pull request 1361 for the long, nice discussion\n(180 entries :-)) leading to the decision to propose contempt 20 as\nthe default value:\n\nhttps://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/1361\n\nWhether Stockfish should strictly adhere to the Komodo and Houdini\nsemantics and add the UCI commands to force the contempt to be White\nin the so-called \"analysis mode\" is still under discussion, and may\nbe or may not be the object of a future commit.\n\nBench: 5783344\n",
