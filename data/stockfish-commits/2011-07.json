I tested it several times and SF always\nended up playing the optimal move. Of course the downside is that now delivering mate\ntakes a bit longer, but IMO it's better to lose once in a while by time in sudden death\ngame than not being able to deliver simple mate with long time controls.\n\nNo functional change.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",

The\npoint is that StateInfo keeps inside a pointer to the previous\nStateInfo in a kind of linked list. But when std::vector<> is\nresized reallocates a larger chunk of memory and moves the\ndata there so these pointers became stale.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue.\n\nNo functional change.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
