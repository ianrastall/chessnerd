Upon closer analysis, it appears that in these cases a shuffle extension is made for every node searched, and progess can not be made. This patch implements a fix, namely to limit the number of extensions relative to the number of nodes searched. The ratio employed is 1/4, which fixes the issues seen so far, but it is a heuristic, and I expect that certain positions might require an even smaller fraction.\n\nThe patch was tested as a bug fix and passed:\n\nSTC:\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 56601 W: 12633 L: 12581 D: 31387\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5d02b37a0ebc5925cf09f6da\n\nLTC:\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 52042 W: 8907 L: 8837 D: 34298\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5d0319420ebc5925cf09fe57\n\nFurthermore, to confirm that the shuffle extension in this form indeed still brings Elo, one more test at VLTC was performed:\nVLTC:\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,3.50]\nTotal: 142022 W: 20963 L: 20435 D: 100624\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5d03630d0ebc5925cf0a011a\n\nBench: 3961247\n",

      "message": "Simplify k-value for passers. Bench: 3854907 (#2182)\n\nStockfish evaluates passed pawns in part based on a variable k, which shapes the passed pawn bonus based on the number of squares between the current square and promotion square that are attacked by enemy pieces, and the number defended by friendly ones. Prior to this commit, we gave a large bonus when all squares between the pawn and the promotion square were defended, and if they were not, a somewhat smaller bonus if at least the pawn's next square was. However, this distinction does not appear to provide any Elo at STC or LTC.\n\n\n\nWhere do we go from here? Many promising Elo-gaining patches were attempted in the past few months to refine passed pawn calculation, by altering the definitions of unsafe and defended squares. Stockfish uses these definitions to choose the value of k, so those tests interact with this PR. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to retest previously promising but not-quite-passing tests in the vicinity of this patch.\n\n\n\nSTC:\n\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\n\nTotal: 42344 W: 9455 L: 9374 D: 23515\n\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5cf83ede0ebc5925cf0904fb\n\n\n\nLTC:\n\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\n\nTotal: 69548 W: 11855 L: 11813 D: 45880\n\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5cf8698f0ebc5925cf0908c8\n\n\n\nBench: 3854907\n",
