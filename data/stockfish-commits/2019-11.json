      "message": "King danger: retire attacked-by-bishop defense\n\nIn a recent commit, \"Introduce king flank defenders,\" a term was introduced\nby Michael Chaly (@Vizvezdenec) to reduce king danger based on king defenders,\ni.e., friendly attacks on our King Flank and Camp. This is a powerful idea\nand broadly applicable to all of our pieces.\n\nAn earlier, but narrower, version of a similar idea was already coded into\nking danger, with a term reducing king danger simply if we had a bishop and\nking attacking the same square -- there is also a similar term for knights,\nbut roughly three times larger. I had attempted to tweak this term's coefficient\nfairly recently, in a series of tests in early September which increased this\ncoefficient.  All failed STC with significantly negative scores.\n\nNow that the king flank defenders term has been introduced, it appears that\nthe bishop-defense term can be simplified away without compensation or\nsignificant Elo loss.\n\nWhere do we go from here? This PR is a natural follow-up to \"Introduce king\nflank defenders,\" which proposed simplification with existing and overlapping\nterms, such as this one.  That PR also mentioned that the coefficient it\nintroduced appeared arbitrary, so perhaps this PR can facilitate a tweak to\nincrease king flank defenders' coefficient.\n\nAdditionally, this pull request is extremely similar to https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/1821,\nwhich was (coincidentally) merged a year ago, to the day (November 23, 2018).\nThat patch also simplified away a linear king danger tropism term, which was\nsoon after replaced with a quadratic term by @Vizvezdenec (which would not have\npassed without the simplification).  @Vizvezdenec, again by coincidence, has\nrecently been trying to implement a quadratic term, this time for defenders\nrather than attackers.  This history of this evaluation code suggests that\nthis simplification might be enough to help a patch for quadratic king-flank\ndefenders pass.\n\nBench: 4959670\n\nSTC:\nLLR: 2.94 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 22209 W: 4920 L: 4800 D: 12489\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5dd444d914339111b9b6bed7\n\nLTC:\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 152107 W: 24658 L: 24743 D: 102706\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5dd4be31f531e81cf278ea9d\n\nInteresting discussion on Github about this pull request:\nhttps://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/2424\n\n---\n\nThis pull request was opened less than one week before the holiday of\nThanksgiving here in the United States.

      "message": "Make Square and Bitboard operators commutative\n\nAs Stockfish developers, we aim to make our code as legible and as close\nto simple English as possible. However, one of the more notable exceptions\nto this rule concerns operations between Squares and Bitboards.\n\nPrior to this pull request, AND, OR, and XOR were only defined when the\nBitboard was the first operand, and the Square the second. For example,\nfor a Bitboard b and Square s, \"b & s\" would be valid but \"s & b\" would not.\nThis conflicts with natural reasoning about logical operators, both\nmathematically and intuitively, which says that logical operators should\ncommute.\n\nMore dangerously, however, both Square and Bitboard are defined as integers\n\"under the hood.\" As a result, code like \"s & b\" would still compile and give\nreasonable bench values. This trap occasionally ensnares even experienced\nStockfish developers, but it is especially dangerous for new developers not\naware of this peculiarity. Because there is no compilation or runtime error,\nand a reasonable bench, only a close review by approvers can spot this error\nwhen a test has been submitted--and many times, these bugs have slipped past\nreview. This is by far the most common logical error on Fishtest, and has\nwasted uncountable STC games over the years.\n\nHowever, it can be fixed by adding three non-functional lines of code. In this\npatch, we define the operators when the operands are provided in the opposite\norder, i.e., we make AND, OR, and XOR commutative for Bitboards and Squares.\nBecause these are inline methods and implemented identically, the executable\ndoes not change at all.\n\nThis patch has the small side-effect of requiring Squares to be explicitly\ncast to integers before AND, OR, or XOR with integers. This is only performed\ntwice in Stockfish's source code, and again does not change the executable at\nall (since Square is an enum defined as an integer anyway).\n\nFor demonstration purposes, this pull request also inverts the order of one AND\nand one OR, to show that neither the bench nor the executable change. (This\nchange can be removed before merging, if preferred.)\n\nI hope that this pull request significantly lowers the barrier-of-entry for new\ndeveloper to join the Stockfish project. I also hope that this change will improve\nour efficiency in using our generous CPU donors' machines, since it will remove\none of the most common causes of buggy tests.\n\nFollowing helpful review and comments by Michael Stembera (@mstembera), we add\na further clean-up by implementing OR for two Squares, to anticipate additional\ntraps developers may encounter and handle them cleanly.\n\nCloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/2387\n\nNo functional change.\n",
