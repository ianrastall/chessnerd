If we start at ss->ply == 1, it would make more sense to\n  go up to and including ss->ply == MAX_PLY, so stop at ss->ply > MAX_PLY. See also\n  the asserts testing for 0 <= ss->ply && ss->ply < MAX_PLY.\n\nThe reason for ss->ply == 1 at the root is the line \"ss->ply = (ss-1)->ply + 1\" at\nthe start for search() and qsearch(). By replacing this with \"(ss+1)->ply = ss->ply + 1\"\nwe keep ss->ply == 0 at the root. Note that search() already clears killers in (ss+2),\nso there is no danger in accessing ss+1.\n\nI have NOT changed pv[MAX_PLY + 1] to pv[MAX_PLY + 2] in search() and qsearch().\nIt seems to me that MAX_PLY + 1 is exactly right:\n\n- MAX_PLY entries for ss->ply running from 0 to MAX_PLY-1, and 1 entry for the\n  final MOVE_NONE.\n\nI have verified that mate scores are reported correctly. (They were already reported\ncorrectly due to the extra ply being rounded down when converting to moves.)\n\nThe value of seldepth output to the user should probably not change, so I add 1 to it.\n(Humans count from 1, computers from 0.)\n\nA small optimisation I did not include: instead of setting ss->ply in every invocation\nof search() and qsearch(), it could be set once for all plies at the start of\nThread::search(). This saves a couple of instructions per node.\n\nNo functional change (unless the search searches a branch MAX_PLY deep), so bench\ndoes not change.\n",

      "message": "Prevent Stockfish from exiting if DTZ table is not present\n\nDuring TB initialisation, Stockfish checks for the presence of WDL\ntables but not for the presence of DTZ tables. When attempting to probe\na DTZ table, it is therefore possible that the table is not present.\nIn that case, Stockfish should neither exit nor report an error.\n\nTo verify the bug:\n$ ./stockfish\nsetoption name SyzygyTable value <path_to_WDL_dir>\nposition fen 8/8/4r3/4k3/8/1K2P3/3P4/6R1 w - -\ngo infinite\nCould not mmap() /opt/tb/regular/KRPPvKR.rtbz\n$\n\n(On my system, the WDL tables are in one directory and the DTZ tables\nin another. If they are in the same directory, it will be difficult\nto trigger the bug.)\n\nThe fix is trivial: check the file descriptor/handle after opening\nthe file.\n\nNo functional change.\n",
