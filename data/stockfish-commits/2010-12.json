      "message": "Remove dubious castle detector\n\nIt was introduced by patch 66d16592 of 22/3/2009 merging\nfrom Glarurung iPhone.\n\nTord says:\nThat change is only found in the Glaurung iPhone app, and not\nin the latest Glaurung UCI source code. I don't remember why\nthis was added (and the iPhone app, unlike the UCI engine,\nwas never version controlled), but it was almost certainly\nbecause it was somehow needed in the communication between\nthe engine and the iPhone GUI, and that it was never meant to be\nincluded in the UCI engine. My guess is that it has something to\ndo with castling moves being entered as e1-g1 in the GUI, but\nrepresented as e1-h1 in the chess engine.\n\nRemoving it in Stockfish should be completely safe, and won't harm\nthe iPhone version. Initially the iPhone GUI called functions in the\nchess engine for checking for legality of moves, writing the move\nlist in SAN format, and various other tasks, but this is no longer\nthe case in the current version.\n\nNo functional change.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
