      "message": "Detect search explosions\n\nThis patch detects some search explosions (due to double extensions in\nsearch.cpp) which can happen in some pathological positions, and takes\nmeasures to ensure progress in search even for these pathological situations.\n\nWhile a small number of double extensions can be useful during search\n(for example to resolve a tactical sequence), a sustained regime of\ndouble extensions leads to search explosion and a non-finishing search.\nSee the discussion in https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/3544\nand the issue https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/issues/3532 .\n\nThe implemented algorithm is the following:\n\na) at each node during search, store the current depth in the stack.\n   Double extensions are by definition levels of the stack where the\n   depth at ply N is strictly higher than depth at ply N-1.\n\nb) during search, calculate for each thread a running average of the\n   number of double extensions in the last 4096 visited nodes.\n\nc) if one thread has more than 2% of double extensions for a sustained\n   period of time (6 millions consecutive nodes, or about 4 seconds on\n   my iMac), we decide that this thread is in an explosion state and\n   we calm down this thread by preventing it to do any double extension\n   for the next 6 millions nodes.\n\nTo calculate the running averages, we also introduced a auxiliary class\ngeneralizing the computations of ttHitAverage variable we already had in\ncode. The implementation uses an exponential moving average of period 4096\nand resolution 1/1024, and all computations are done with integers for\nefficiency.\n\n-----------\n\nExample where the patch solves a search explosion:\n\n```\n   ./stockfish\n   ucinewgame\n   position fen 8/Pk6/8/1p6/8/P1K5/8/6B1 w - - 37 130\n   go infinite\n```\n\nThis algorithm does not affect search in normal, non-pathological positions.\nWe verified, for instance, that the usual bench is unchanged up to depth 20\nat least, and that the node numbers are unchanged for a search of the starting\nposition at depth 32.\n\n-------------\n\nSee https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/3714\n\nBench: 5575265\n",
