The depth printed is anyway a convention, let's consider adjustedDepth\n   an implementation detail, and continue to print rootDepth. Depth, nodes, time and\n   move quality all increase as we compute more. (fixing this output has no effect on\n   play).\n\n2) Fixes go depth output (now based on rootDepth again, no effect on play), also\n   reported in issue #1787\n\n3) The depth lastBestDepth is used to compute how long a move is stable, a new move\n   found during fail-high is incorrectly considered stable if based on adjustedDepth\n   instead of rootDepth (this changes time management). Reverting this passed STC\n   and LTC:\n\n   STC\n   LLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\n   Total: 82982 W: 17810 L: 17808 D: 47364\n   http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5bd391a80ebc595e0ae1e993\n\n   LTC\n   LLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\n   Total: 109083 W: 17602 L: 17619 D: 73862\n   http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5bd40c820ebc595e0ae1f1fb\n\n4) In the thread voting scheme, the rank of the fail-high thread is now artificially\n   low, incorrectly since the quality of the move is much better than what adjustedDepth\n   suggests (e.g. if it takes 10 iterations to find VALUE_KNOWN_WIN, it has very low\n   depth). Further evidence comes from a test that showed that the move of highest\n   depth is not better than that of the last PV (which is potentially of much lower\n   adjustedDepth).\n\n   I.e. this test http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5bd37a120ebc595e0ae1e7c3\n   failed SPRT[0, 5]:\n\n   LLR: -2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,5.00]\n   Total: 10609 W: 2266 L: 2345 D: 5998\n\n   In a running 5+0.05 th 8 test (more than 10000 games) a positive Elo estimate is\n   shown (strong enough for a [-3,1], possibly not [0,4]):\n\n   http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5bd421be0ebc595e0ae1f315\n   LLR: -0.13 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,4.00]\n   Total: 13644 W: 2573 L: 2532 D: 8539\n   Elo\t1.04 [-2.52,4.61] / LOS 71%\n\nThus, restore old behavior as a bugfix, keeping the core of the fail-high patch\nidea as resolving scheme.

It was noted that after\nsome time, the NPS of the kibitzing Stockfish (which is usually 3x faster\nthan the Stockfish actually competing) would drop precipitously, eventually\nfalling to preposterously low numbers until restarted.\n\nTheir eval bot basically inputs FEN, go infinite, stop and loop, it probably\ndidn't do ucinewgame either. As time goes it gradually slowed down and OS\nstarts to use swap, this is not reasonable since the engine only uses 16GB\nhash and the machine has 1TB physical RAM and does nothing else.\n\nAuthor : noobpwnftw\n\nCloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/1790\n\nNo functional change.\n",

This random component is not static, but\npotentially different for each visit of the node (hence derived from the node\ncounter). The effect is that in positions with many 3fold draw lines, different\nlines are followed at each iteration. This keeps the search much more dynamic,\nas opposed to being locked to one particular 3fold.\n\nAn example of a position where master suffers from 3fold-blindness and this patch\nsolves quickly is the famous TCEC game 53:\n\nFEN: 3r2k1/pr6/1p3q1p/5R2/3P3p/8/5RP1/3Q2K1 b - - 0 51\n\nmaster doesn't see that this is a lost position (draw eval up to depth 50) as\nQf6-e6 d4-d5 (found by patch at depth 23) leads to a loss.\n\nThe 3fold-blindness is more important at longer TC, the patch was yellow STC and\nLTC, but passed VLTC:\n\nSTC\nLLR: -2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,5.00]\nTotal: 46328 W: 10048 L: 9953 D: 26327\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5b9c0ca20ebc592cf275f7c7\n\nLTC\nLLR: -2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,5.00]\nTotal: 54663 W: 8938 L: 8846 D: 36879\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5b9ca1610ebc592cf27601d3\n\nVLTC\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,5.00]\nTotal: 31789 W: 4512 L: 4284 D: 22993\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5b9d1a670ebc592cf276076d\n\nCredit to @crossbr for pointing to this problem repeatedly, and giving the hint\nthat many draw lines are typical in those situations.\n\nBench: 4756639\n",
