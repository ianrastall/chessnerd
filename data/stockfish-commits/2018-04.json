The ranking code is much more straightforward than the current\nfiltering code (this is a simplification), and also more versatile.\n\nIf the root is a TB position, each root move is probed and assigned a TB score\nand a TB rank. The TB score is the Value to be displayed to the user for that\nmove (unless the search finds a mate score), while the TB rank determines which\nmoves should appear higher in a multi-pv search. In game play, the engine will\nalways pick a move with the highest rank.\n\nRanks run from -1000 to +1000:\n\n901 to 1000   : TB win\n900           : normally a TB win, in rare cases this could be a draw\n1 to 899      : cursed TB wins\n0             : draw\n-1 to -899    : blessed TB losses\n-900          : normally a TB loss, in rare cases this could be a draw\n-901 to -1000 : TB loss\n\nNormally all winning moves get rank 1000 (to let the search pick the best\namong them). The exception is if there has been a first repetition. In that\ncase, moves are ranked strictly by DTZ so that the engine will play a move\nthat lowers DTZ (and therefore cannot repeat the position a second time).\n\nLosing moves get rank -1000 unless they have relatively high DTZ, meaning\nthey have some drawing chances. Those get ranks towards -901 (when they\ncross -900 the draw is certain).\n\nCloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/1467\n\nNo functional change (without tablebases).\n",

      "message": "Introduce Overload\n\nThis patch applies a S(10, 5) bonus for every square that is:\n\n- Occupied by an enemy piece which is not a pawn\n- Attacked exactly once by our pieces\n- Defended exactly once by enemy pieces\n\nThe idea is that these pieces must be defended. Their defenders have\ndramatically limited mobility, and they are vulnerable to our future\nattack.\n\nAs with connectivity, there are probably many more tests to be run in\nthis area. In particular:\n\n- I believe @snicolet's queen overload tests have demonstrated a potential\n  need for a queen overload bonus above and beyond this one; however, the\n  conditions for \"overload\" in this patch are different (excluding pieces\n  we attack twice).  My next test after this is (hopefully) merged will be\n  to intersect the Bitboard I define here with the enemy's queen attacks and\n  attempt to give additional bonus.\n- Perhaps we should exclude pieces attacked by pawns--can pawns really be\n  overloaded? Should they have the same weight, or less?  This didn't work\n  with a previous version, but it could work with this one.\n- More generally, different pieces may need more or less bonus. We could\n  change bonuses based on what type of enemy piece is being overloaded, what\n  type of friendly piece is attacking, and/or what type of piece is being\n  defended by the overloaded piece and attacked by us, or any intersection\n  of these three.  For example, here attacked/defended pawns are excluded,\n  but they're not totally worthless targets, and could be added again with\n  a smaller bonus.\n- This list is by no means exhaustive.\n\nSTC:\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,5.00]\nTotal: 17439 W: 3599 L: 3390 D: 10450\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5ac78a2e0ebc59435923735e\n\nLTC:\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,5.00]\nTotal: 43304 W: 6533 L: 6256 D: 30515\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5ac7a1d80ebc59435923736f\n\nCloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/1533\n\nBench: 5248871\n\n----------------\n\nThis is my first time opening a PR, so I apologize if there are errors.\nThere are too many people to thank since I submitted my first test just\nover a month ago.
