But in case of Microsoft MSVC\nwe don't have a Makefile and the order of files compilation\nis chosen by the compiler (in an unpredictable way). So it\ncould still happen that error is not detected (as in my case),\nbut in another case the order of compilation of the files could\nbe so that at some point both operator^ were defined before\nopposite_colors() and this triggers the error.\n\nThe fix is much simpler than the explanation :-)\n\nReported by Quocvuong82.\n\nNo functional change.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
