Maybe some variables changed randomly or because result\nwas not sensitive enough to them. So my explanation of changes will\nnot be necessarily correct, but here it is.\n\n• When decrease of thinking time was added by Joost a few months ago\nif best move has not changed for several plies, one more competing\nindicator  was introduced for the same purpose along with increase\nin score and absence of fail low at root. It seems that tuning put\nrelatively more importance on that new indicator what allowed to save\ntime.\n• Some of this saved time is distributed proportionally between all\nmoves and some more time were given to moves when score dropped a lot\nor best move changed.\n• It looks also that SPSA redistributed more time from the beginning to\nlater stages of game via other changes in variables - maybe because\ncontempt made game to last longer or for whatever reason.\n\nAll of this is just small tweaks here and there (a few percentages changes).\n\nSTC (10+0.1):\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,4.00]\nTotal: 18970 W: 4268 L: 4029 D: 10673\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a9291a40ebc590297cc8881\n\nLTC (60+0.6):\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [0.00,4.00]\nTotal: 72027 W: 12263 L: 11878 D: 47886\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a92d7510ebc590297cc88ef\n\nAdditional non-regression tests at other time controls\n\nSudden death 60s:\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [-4.00,0.00]\nTotal: 14444 W: 2715 L: 2608 D: 9121\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a9445850ebc590297cc8a65\n\n40 moves repeating at LTC:\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [-4.00,0.00]\nTotal: 10309 W: 1880 L: 1759 D: 6670\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a9566ec0ebc590297cc8be1\n\nThis is a functional patch only for time management, but the bench\ndoes not reflect this because it uses fixed depth search, so the number\nof nodes does not change during bench.\n\nNo functional change.\n",

As such, it is currently possible to enter a state\nin which ttValue has a specific value which is inconsistent with tte->bound() and\ntte->depth(). Currently, ttValue is only used within the search in a context that\nprevents this situation from making a difference (and so this change is non-functional,\nbut this is not guaranteed to remain the case in the future.\n\nFor instance, just changing the tt depth condition in singular extension node to be\n\n    tte->depth() >= depth - 4 * ONE_PLY\n\ninstead of\n\n    tte->depth() >= depth - 3 * ONE_PLY\n\ninteracts badly with the absence of ttMove in iid. For the ttMove to become a singular\nextension candidate, singularExtensionNode needs to be true. With the current master,\nthis requires that tte->depth() >= depth - 3 * ONE_PLY. This is not currently possible\nif tte comes from IID, since the depth 'd' used for the IID search is always less than\ndepth - 4 * ONE_PLY for depth >= 8 * ONE_PLY (below depth 8 singularExtensionNode can\nnever be true anyway). However, with DU-jdto/Stockfish@251281a , this condition can be\nmet, and it is possible for singularExtensionNode to become true after IID. There are\nthen two mechanisms by which this patch can affect the search:\n\n• If ttValue was VALUE_NONE prior to IID, the fact that this patch sets ttValue allows\n  the 'ttValue != VALUE_NONE' condition of singularExtensionNode to be met.\n\n• If ttValue wasn't VALUE_NONE prior to IID, the fact that this patch modifies ttValue's\n  value causes a different 'rBeta' to be calculated if the singular extension search is\n  performed.\n\nTested at STC for non-regression:\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 76981 W: 17060 L: 17048 D: 42873\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a7738b70ebc5902971a9868\n\nNo functional change\n",

      "message": "Retire \"Extra thinking before accepting draw PVs\"\n\nThis patch simplifies the time management code, removing the extra\nthinking time for moves with draw PV and increasing thinking time\nfor all moves proportionally by around 4%.\n\nLast time when the time management was carefully tuned was 1.5-2 years\nago. As new patches were getting added, time management was drifting out\nof optimum. This happens because when search becomes more precise pv and\nscore are becoming more stable, there are less fail lows, best move is\npicked earlier and there are less best move changes. All this factors are\nentering in time management, and average time per move is decreasing with\nmore and more good patches. For individual patches such effect is small\n(except some) and may be up or down, but when there are many of them,\neffect is more substantial. The same way benchmark with more and more\npatches is slowly drifting down on average.\n\nSo my understanding that back in October adding more think time for draw\nPV showed positive Elo because time management was not well tuned, there\nwas more time available, and think_hard patch applied this additional time\nto moves with draw PV, while just retuning back to optimum would recover Elo\nanyway. It is possible that absence of contempt also helped, as SF9 is showing\nless 0.0 scores than the October version.\n\nAnyway, to me it seems that proper place to deal with draw PV is search, and\ncontempt sounds as much better solution. In time management there is little\nadditional elo, and if some code is not helping like removed here, it is better\nto discard it. It is simpler to find genuine improvement if code is clean.\n\n• Passed STC:\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 20487 W: 4558 L: 4434 D: 11495\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a7706ec0ebc5902971a9854\n\n• Passed LTC:\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 41960 W: 7145 L: 7058 D: 27757\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a778c830ebc5902971a9895\n\n• Passed an additional non-regression [-5..0] test at the time control\nof 60sec for the game (sudden death) with disabled draw adjudication:\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [-5.00,0.00]\nTotal: 8438 W: 1675 L: 1586 D: 5177\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a7c3d8d0ebc5902971a9ac0\n\n• Passed an additional non-regression [-5..0] test at the time control\nof 1sec+1sec per move with disabled draw adjudication:\nLLR: 2.97 (-2.94,2.94) [-5.00,0.00]\nTotal: 27664 W: 5575 L: 5574 D: 16515\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a7c3e820ebc5902971a9ac3\n\nThis is a functional change for the time management code.\n\nBench: 4983414\n",
