But if we run the same binary on a\nCore i7 system, because POPCNT is detected at run time, the dummy\nbitcount functions will be called giving false results that will\ncrash the application.\n\nNote that would be possible to fallback on software bit count in\nthese cases, but this is even more subtle because POPCNT path is not\noptimized so that we have an application working but at sub-optimal\nspeed, so better to crash, at least user is loudly warned that there\nis something wrong.\n\nIf, instead, Stockfish is compiled on a Core i7 system with POPCNT\nenabled, then if the PGO compile has been done properly, the same binary\nwill run at optimal speed _both_ on the Core i7 machine and on any other\n64 bit standard machine. This is the ideal mode for binary distribution.\n\nFinally this patch disables bsfq support under Windows, because it seems\ninline assembly is not supported both by MSVC and by Intel Windows version.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
