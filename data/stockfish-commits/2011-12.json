Instead in case of pthread_cond_signal(), if there\nare no waiting threads it has no effect. What we may want is something\nlike PulseEvent() instead of SetEvent(). Unfortunatly it is documented\nby Mcrosoft as 'unreliable' due to spurious wakes up that could\nfilter out the signal resetting. So we opt to reset manually any\npending signaled state before to go to sleep.\n\nThis fixes the strange misbehaves during 'stockfish bench'\nwhen using OLD_LOCKS under Windows.\n\nNo functional change.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
