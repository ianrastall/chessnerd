It's the reinterpretation of the unsigned\nresult (large value) as a signed int that happens to give the correct result,\nthanks to 2's complement. This is all tricky and dangerous!\n\nIn the spirit of the standard, we assume nothing on the signedness of enums,\nand simply calculate the rank and file distances as:\n- rank_dist(r1, r2) = r1 < r2 ? r2 - r1 : r1 - r2\n- file_dist(f1, f2) = f1 < f2 ? f2 - f1 : f1 - f2\nthis logic can in fact be applied to any enum we may use, so for better\ngenerality and to avoid code duplication, we use a template function diff()\nhere.\n\nNo functional change.\n\nResolves #95\n",

Now,\nit's not clear why we use MAX_PLY = 120, or why we use MAX_PLY+6, among\nother things.\n\nThis patch does the following:\n\n* ID loop: depth ranges from 1 to MAX_PLY-1, and due to TT constraint (depth\nmust fit into an int8_t), MAX_PLY should be 128.\n\n* stack[]: plies now range from 0 to MAX_PLY-1, hence stack[MAX_PLY+4],\nbecause of the extra 2+2 padding elements (for ss-2 and ss+2). Document this\nbetter, while we're at it.\n\n* Enforce 0 <= ply < MAX_PLY:\n  - stop condition is now ss->ply >= MAX_PLY and not ss->ply > MAX_PLY.\n  - assert(ss->ply < MAX_PLY), before using ss+1 and ss+2.\n  - as a result, we don't need the artificial MAX_PLY+6 range. Instead we\n  can use MAX_PLY+4 and it's clear why (for ss-2 and ss+2).\n\n* fix: extract_pv_from_tt() and insert_pv_in_tt() had no reason to use\nMAX_PLY_PLUS_6, because the array is indexed by plies, so the range of\navailable plies applies (0..MAX_PLY before, and now 0..MAX_PLY-1).\n\nTested with debug compile, using MAX_PLY=16, and running bench at depth 17,\nusing 1 and 7 threads.
