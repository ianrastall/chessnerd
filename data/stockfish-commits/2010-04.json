The null move search\nfails high, and no verification search is done, because the\ndepth is too small. The position gets stored in the transposition\ntable with a good score and a depth of d.\n\nNow, consider what happens when the same position occurs at iteration\nN+1, this time with a depth of d+OnePly (i.e. one ply deeper than at\nthe previous iteration). Once again, the null move search fails\nhigh. The point is that the verification search will also fail high,\nbecause of an instant transposition table cutoff caused by the value\nstored in the TT during the previous iteration.\"\n\nWith this patch we simply do not allow TT cutoffs at the root node\nof a null move verification search if the TT value was found by a\nnull search.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
