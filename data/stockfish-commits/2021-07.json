      "message": "Avoid unnecessary stores in the affine transform\n\nThis patch improves the codegen in the AffineTransform::forward function for architectures >=SSSE3. Current code works directly on memory and the compiler cannot see that the stores through outptr do not alias the loads through weights and input32. The solution implemented is to perform the affine transform with local variables as accumulators and only store the result to memory at the end. The number of accumulators required is OutputDimensions / OutputSimdWidth, which means that for the 1024->16 affine transform it requires 4 registers with SSSE3, 2 with AVX2, 1 with AVX512. It also cuts the number of stores required by NumRegs * 256 for each node evaluated. The local accumulators are expected to be assigned to registers, but even if this cannot be done in some case due to register pressure it will help the compiler to see that there is no aliasing between the loads and stores and may still result in better codegen.\n\nSee https://godbolt.org/z/59aTKbbYc for codegen comparison.\n\npassed STC:\nLLR: 2.94 (-2.94,2.94) <-0.50,2.50>\nTotal: 140328 W: 10635 L: 10358 D: 119335\nPtnml(0-2): 302, 8339, 52636, 8554, 333\n\ncloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/3634\n\nNo functional change\n",

      "message": "New NNUE architecture and net\n\nIntroduces a new NNUE network architecture and associated network parameters\n\nThe summary of the changes:\n\n* Position for each perspective mirrored such that the king is on e..h files. Cuts the feature transformer size in half, while preserving enough knowledge to be good. See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gTlrr02qSNKiXNZ_SuO4-RjK4MXBiFlLE6jvNqqMkAY/edit#heading=h.b40q4rb1w7on.\n* The number of neurons after the feature transformer increased two-fold, to 1024x2. This is possibly mostly due to the now very optimized feature transformer update code.\n* The number of neurons after the second layer is reduced from 16 to 8, to reduce the speed impact. This, perhaps surprisingly, doesn't harm the strength much. See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gTlrr02qSNKiXNZ_SuO4-RjK4MXBiFlLE6jvNqqMkAY/edit#heading=h.6qkocr97fezq\n\nThe AffineTransform code did not work out-of-the box with the smaller number of neurons after the second layer, so some temporary changes have been made to add a special case for InputDimensions == 8. Also additional 0 padding is added to the output for some archs that cannot process inputs by <=8 (SSE2, NEON). VNNI uses an implementation that can keep all outputs in the registers while reducing the number of loads by 3 for each 16 inputs, thanks to the reduced number of output neurons. However GCC is particularily bad at optimization here (and perhaps why the current way the affine transform is done even passed sprt) (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gTlrr02qSNKiXNZ_SuO4-RjK4MXBiFlLE6jvNqqMkAY/edit# for details) and more work will be done on this in the following days. I expect the current VNNI implementation to be improved and extended to other architectures.\n\nThe network was trained with a slightly modified version of the pytorch trainer (https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch); the changes are in https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/pull/143\n\nThe training utilized 2 datasets.\n\n    dataset A - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VlhnHL8f-20AXhGkILujnNXHwy9T-MQw/view?usp=sharing\n    dataset B - as described in https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commit/ba01f4b95448bcb324755f4dd2a632a57c6e67bc\n\nThe training process was as following:\n\n    train on dataset A for 350 epochs, take the best net in terms of elo at 20k nodes per move (it's fine to take anything from later stages of training).\n    convert the .ckpt to .pt\n    --resume-from-model from the .pt file, train on dataset B for <600 epochs, take the best net.

They were then interleaved together. The idea was to give Wrong_NNUE.binpack closer to equal weighting with the Training_Data binpack\n\nmodel.py modifications:\nloss = torch.pow(torch.abs(p - q), 2.6).mean()\nLR = 8.0e-5 calculated as follows: 1.5e-3*(.992^360) - the idea here was to take a highly trained net and just use all.binpack as a finishing micro refinement touch for the last 2 Elo or so. This net was discovered on the 59th epoch.\noptimizer = ranger.Ranger(train_params, betas=(.90, 0.999), eps=1.0e-7, gc_loc=False, use_gc=False)\nscheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=1, gamma=0.992)\nFor this micro optimization, I had set the period to \"5\" in train.py. This changes the checkpoint output so that every 5th checkpoint file is created\n\nThe final touches were to adjust the NNUE scale, as was done by Jonathan in tests running at the same time.\n\npassed LTC\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/60fa45aed8a6b65b2f3a77a4\nLLR: 2.94 (-2.94,2.94) <0.50,3.50>\nTotal: 53040 W: 1732 L: 1575 D: 49733\nPtnml(0-2): 14, 1432, 23474, 1583, 17\n\npassed STC\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/60f9fee2d8a6b65b2f3a7775\nLLR: 2.94 (-2.94,2.94) <-0.50,2.50>\nTotal: 37928 W: 3178 L: 3001 D: 31749\nPtnml(0-2): 100, 2446, 13695, 2623, 100.\n\ncloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/3626\n\nBench: 5169957\n",
