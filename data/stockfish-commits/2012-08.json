This is currently true, but could\nchange in the future and we don't want to rely\non code that works 'by accident'. The threads\nare still running when ThreadPool destructor is\ncalled (after main() returns) and this could\nlead to crashes if a thread accesses a global\nthat has been already freed.

      "message": "Correctly handle handover of setup states\n\nBefore the search we setup the starting position doing all the\nmoves (sent by GUI) from start position to the position just\nbefore to start searching.\n\nTo do this we use a set of StateInfo records used by each\ndo_move() call. These records shall be kept valid during all\nthe search because repetition draw detection uses them to back\ntrack all the earlier positions keys. The problem is that, while\nsearching, the GUI could send another 'position' command, this\ncalls set_position() that clears the states! Of course a crash\nfollows shortly.\n\nBefore searching all the relevant parameters are copied in\nstart_searching() just for this reason: to fully detach data\naccessed during the search from the UCI protocol handling.\nSo the natural solution would be to copy also the setup states.\nUnfortunatly this approach does not work because StateInfo\ncontains a pointer to the previous record, so naively copying and\nthen freeing the original memory leads to a crash.\n\nThat's why we use two std::auto_ptr (one belonging to UCI and another\nto Search) to safely transfer ownership of the StateInfo records to\nthe search, after we have setup the root position.\n\nAs a nice side-effect all the possible memory leaks are magically\nsorted out for us by std::auto_ptr semantic.\n\nNo functional change.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marco Costalba <mcostalba@gmail.com>\n",
