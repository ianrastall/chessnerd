      "message": "Allow for general transposition table sizes. (#1341)\n\nFor efficiency reasons current master only allows for transposition table sizes that are N = 2^k in size, the index computation can be done efficiently as (hash % N) can be written instead as (hash & 2^k - 1). On a typical computer (with 4, 8... etc Gb of RAM), this implies roughly half the RAM is left unused in analysis.\n\n\n\nThis issue was mentioned on fishcooking by Mindbreaker:\n\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a3587de0ebc590ccbb8be04\n\n\n\nRecently a neat trick was proposed to map a hash into the range [0,N[ more efficiently than (hash % N) for general N, nearly as efficiently as (hash % 2^k):\n\n\n\nhttps://lemire.me/blog/2016/06/27/a-fast-alternative-to-the-modulo-reduction/\n\n\n\nnamely computing (hash * N / 2^32) for 32 bit hashes. This patch implements this trick and now allows for general hash sizes. Note that for N = 2^k this just amounts to using a different subset of bits from the hash. Master will use the lower k bits, this trick will use the upper k bits (of the 32 bit hash).\n\n\n\nThere is no slowdown as measured with [-3, 1] test:\n\n\n\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a3587de0ebc590ccbb8be04\n\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\n\nTotal: 128498 W: 23332 L: 23395 D: 81771\n\n\n\nThere are two (smaller) caveats:\n\n\n\n1) the patch is implemented for a 32 bit hash (so that a 64 bit multiply can be used), this effectively limits the number of clusters that can be used to 2^32 or to 128Gb of transpostion table. That's a change in the maximum allowed TT size, which could bother those using 256Gb or more regularly.\n\n\n\n2) Already in master, an excluded move is hashed into the position key in rather simple way, essentially only affecting the lower 16 bits of the key. This is OK in master, since bits 0-15 end up in the index, but not in the new scheme, which picks the higher bits. This is 'fixed' by shifting the excluded move a few bits up. Eventually a better hashing scheme seems wise.\n\n\n\nDespite these two caveats, I think this is a nice improvement in usability.\n\n\n\nBench: 5346341\n",

      "message": "A better contempt implementation for Stockfish (#1325)\n\n* A better contempt implementation for Stockfish\n\n\n\nThe round 2 of TCEC season 10 demonstrated the benefit of having a nice contempt implementation: it gives the strongest programs in the tournament the ability to slow down the game when they feel the position is slightly worse, prefering to stay in a complicated (even if slightly risky) middle game rather than simplifying by force into a drawn endgame.\n\n\n\nThe current contempt implementation of Stockfish is inadequate, and this patch is an attempt to provide a better one.\n\n\n\nPassed STC non-regression test against master:\n\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\n\nTotal: 83360 W: 15089 L: 15075 D: 53196\n\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5a1bf2de0ebc590ccbb8b370\n\n\n\nThis contempt implementation is showing promising results in certains situations. For instance, it obtained a nice +30 Elo gain when playing with contempt=40 against Stockfish 7, compared to current master:\n\n\n\n• master against SF 7 (20000 games at LTC): +121.2 Elo\n\n• this patch with contempt=40 (20000 games at LTC): +154.11 Elo\n\n\n\nThis was the result of real cooperative work from the Stockfish team, with key ideas coming from Stefan Geschwentner (locutus2) and Chris Cain (ceebo) while most of the community helped with feedback and computer time.\n\n\n\nIn this commit the bench is unchanged by default, but you can test at home with the new contempt in the UCI options. The style of play will change a lot when using contempt different of zero (I repeat: not done in this version by default, however)!\n\n\n\nThe Stockfish team is still deliberating over the best default contempt value in self-play and the best contempt modeling strategy, to help users choosing a contempt value when playing against much weaker programs. These informations will be given in future commits when available :-)\n\n\n\nBench: 5051254\n\n\n\n* Remove the prefetch\n\n\n\nNo functional change.\n",

      "message": "Use a Direction enum for Square deltas\n\nCurrently the NORTH/WEST/SOUTH/EAST values are of type Square, but conceptually they are not squares but directions. This patch separates these values into a Direction enum and overloads addition and subtraction to allow adding a Square to a Direction (to get a new Square).\n\n\n\nI have also slightly trimmed the possible overloadings to improve type safety. For example, it would normally not make sense to add a Color to a Color or a Piece to a Piece, or to multiply or divide them by an integer. It would also normally not make sense to add a Square to a Square.\n\n\n\nThis is a non-functional change.\n",
