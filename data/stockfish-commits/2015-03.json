      "message": "Add support for playing in 'nodes as time' mode\n\nWhen running more games in parallel, or simply when running a game\nwith a background process, due to how OS scheduling works, there is no\nguarantee that the CPU resources allocated evenly between the two\nplayers. This introduces noise in the result that leads to unreliable\nresult and in the worst cases can even invalidate the result. For\ninstance in SF test framework we avoid running from clouds virtual\nmachines because are a known source of very unstable CPU speed.\n\nTo overcome this issue, without requiring changes to the GUI, the idea\nis to use searched nodes instead of time, and to convert time to\navailable nodes upfront, at the beginning of the game.\n\nWhen nodestime UCI option is set at a given nodes per milliseconds\n(npmsec), at the beginning of the game (and only once), the engine\nreads the available time to think, sent by the GUI with 'go wtime x'\nUCI command. Then it translates time in available nodes (nodes =\nnpmsec * x), then feeds available nodes instead of time to the time\nmanagement logic and starts the search. During the search the engine\nchecks the searched nodes against the available ones in such a way\nthat all the time management logic still fully applies, and the game\nmimics a real one played on real time. When the search finishes,\nbefore returning best move, the total available nodes are updated,\nsubtracting the real searched nodes. After the first move, the time\ninformation sent by the GUI is ignored, and the engine fully relies on\nthe updated total available nodes to feed time management.\n\nTo avoid time losses, the speed of the engine (npms) must be set to a\nvalue lower than real speed so that if the real TC is for instance 30\nsecs, and npms is half of the real speed, the game will last on\naverage 15 secs, so much less than the TC limit, providing for a\nsafety 'time buffer'.\n\nThere are 2 main limitations with this mode.\n\n1. Engine speed should be the same for both players, and this limits\nthe approach to mainly parameter tuning patches.\n\n2. Because npms is fixed while, in real engines, the speed increases\ntoward endgame, this introduces an artifact that is equivalent to an\naltered time management. Namely it is like the time management gives\nless available time than what should be in standard case.\n\nMay be the second limitation could be mitigated in a future with a\nsmarter 'dynamic npms' approach.\n\nTests shows that the standard deviation of the results with 'nodestime'\nis lower than in standard TC, as is expected because now all the introduced\nnoise due the random speed variability of the engines during the game is\nfully removed.\n\nOriginal NIT idea by Michael Hoffman that shows how to play in NIT mode\nwithout requiring changes to the GUI. This implementation goes a bit\nfurther, the key difference is that we read TC from GUI only once upfront\ninstead of re-reading after every move as in Michael's implementation.\n\nNo functional change.\n",
