It appears that this condition is not\nnecessary. The idea is that the doubled pawns are likely to be weak and\none of them will be likely captured anyway. On the other hand, if we do\nsomehow manage to promote a pawn, then the pawn behind it becomes passed\nas well. In any case, the end result is we end up with an extra\npotentially passed pawn. The current evaluation for passed pawns already\nhandles this case by also scaling down this effect.\n\nSTC:\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 28291 W: 6287 L: 6178 D: 15826\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5b6c4b960ebc5902bdb9f256\n\nLTC:\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) [-3.00,1.00]\nTotal: 30717 W: 5256 L: 5151 D: 20310\nhttp://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/5b6c82980ebc5902bdb9f863\n\nBench: 4938285\n",
