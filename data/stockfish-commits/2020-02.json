The idea is to block the pawn (preferably behind the Troitsky line) with one of the knights and press the weakSide king into a corner. If we can stalemate the king, we release the pawn with the knight (to avoid actual stalemate), and use the knight to complete the mate before the pawn promotes. This is also why there is an additional penalty for advancement of the pawn.\n\ncloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/2553\n\nBench: 4981770\n",
