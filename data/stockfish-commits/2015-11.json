Here\nis an article that explains it very clearly:\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt\n\nNo matter how we define TTEntry or TTCluster, there will never be any unaligned\nmemory access. This is because the complier knows the alignment rules, and does\nthe necessary adjustments to make sure unaligned memory access does not occur.\n\nThe issue being adressed here has nothing to do with unaligned memory access. It\nis about cache performance. In order to achieve best cache performance:\n- we prefetch the cacheline as soon as possible.\n- we ensure that TT clusters do not spread across two cachelines. If they did,\n  we would need to prefetch 2 cachelines, which could hurt cache performance.\n\nTherefore the true conditions to achieve this are:\n1/ start adress of TT is cache line aligned. void TranspositionTable::resize()\nenforces this.\n2/ TT cluster size should *divide* the cache line size. Currently, we pack 2\nclusters per cache lines. It used to be 1 before \"TT sardines\". Does not matter\nwhat the ratio is, all we want is to fit an integer number of clusters per cache\nline.\n\nNo functional change.\n\nResolves #506\n",
