      "message": "Better document null search window\n\nHopefully this patch makes the code more:\n\n* Self-documenting: Null search is always a zero window search,\n  because it is testing for a fail high. It should never be done\n  on a full window! The current code only works because we don't\n  do it at PV nodes, and therefore (alpha, beta) = (beta-1, beta):\n  that's the kind of \"clever\" trick we should avoid.\n\n* Idiot-proof: If we want to enable null search at PV nodes, all we\n  need to do now is comment out the !PvNode condition. It's that simple!\n\nIn theory, null search should not be done at PV nodes, because PV nodes\nshould never fail high. But in practice, they DO fail high, because of\naspiration windows, and search inconsistencies, for example. So it makes\nsense to keep that flexibility in the code.\n\nNo functional change.\n",

It took THREE attempts to code razoring\nat PV nodes correctly in a recent test, because of the rbeta trick.\nUnnecessary tricks should be avoided.\n\n* The more correct and self-documenting way of doing this, is to say\nthat we use a zero window around alpha-margin, not beta-margin.\nThe fact that, because we only do it at PV nodes, alpha happens to be\nbeta-1 and that the current stuff with rbeta works, may be correct,\nbut is confusing.\n\nRemove the misleading and partially erroneous comment about returning\nv + margin:\n\n* comments should explain what the code does, not what it could have done.\n\n* this comment is partially wrong in saying that v+margin is \"logical\",\n  and that it is \"surprising\" that is doesn't work.\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, at least 3 ways of doing this are equally\ndefendable:\n\n1/ fail hard: return alpha: The most conservative. We bet that the search\nwill fail low, but we don't know by how much and don't want to take risks.\n\n2/ aggressive fail soft: return v (what the current code does). This\ncorresponds to normal fail soft, with the added assumption that we don't\ncare about the reduction effect (see below point 3/)\n\n3/ conservative fail soft: return v + margin. If the reduced search (qsearch)\ngives us a score <= v, we bet that the non reduced search will give us a\nscore <= v + margin.\n\n* Saying that 2/ is \"logical\" implies that 1/ and 3/ are not, which is\narguably wrong. Besides, experimental results tell us that 2/ beats 3/,\nand that's not something we can argue against: experimental results are\nthe only trusted metric.\n\n* Also, with the benefit of hindsight, I don't think the fact that 2/ is\nbetter than 3/ is surprising at all. The point is that it is YOUR turn to\nmove, and you are assuming that by NOT playing (and letting the opponent\ncapture your hanging pieces in QS) you cannot generally GAIN razor_margin(depth).\n\nNo functional change.\n",
