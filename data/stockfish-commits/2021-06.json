      "message": "Stockfish 14\n\nOfficial release version of Stockfish 14\n\nBench: 4770936\n\n---\n\nToday, we have the pleasure to announce Stockfish 14.\n\nAs usual, downloads will be freely available at https://stockfishchess.org\n\nThe engine is now significantly stronger than just a few months ago,\nand wins four times more game pairs than it loses against the previous\nrelease version [0]. Stockfish 14 is now at least 400 Elo ahead of\nStockfish 7, a top engine in 2016 [1]. During the last five years,\nStockfish has thus gained about 80 Elo per year.\n\nStockfish 14 evaluates positions more accurately than Stockfish 13 as\na result of two major steps forward in defining and training the\nefficiently updatable neural network (NNUE) that provides the evaluation\nfor positions.\n\nFirst, the collaboration with the Leela Chess Zero team - announced\npreviously [2] - has come to fruition. The LCZero team has provided a\ncollection of billions of positions evaluated by Leela that we have\ncombined with billions of positions evaluated by Stockfish to train the\nNNUE net that powers Stockfish 14. The fact that we could use and combine\nthese datasets freely was essential for the progress made and demonstrates\nthe power of open source and open data [3].\n\nSecond, the architecture of the NNUE network was significantly updated:\nthe new network is not only larger, but more importantly, it deals better\nwith large material imbalances and can specialize for multiple phases of\nthe game [4]. A new project, kick-started by Gary Linscott and\nTomasz Sobczyk, led to a GPU accelerated net trainer written in\npytorch.[5] This tool allows for training high-quality nets in a couple\nof hours.\n\nFinally, this release features some search refinements, minor bug\nfixes and additional improvements. For example, Stockfish is now about\n90 Elo stronger for chess960 (Fischer random chess) at short time control.\n\nThe Stockfish project builds on a thriving community of enthusiasts\n(thanks everybody!) that contribute their expertise, time, and resources\nto build a free and open-source chess engine that is robust, widely\navailable, and very strong. We invite our chess fans to join the fishtest\ntesting framework and programmers to contribute to the project on\ngithub [6].\n\nStay safe and enjoy chess!\n\nThe Stockfish team\n\n[0] https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/60dae5363beab81350aca077\n[1] https://nextchessmove.com/dev-builds\n[2] https://stockfishchess.org/blog/2021/stockfish-13/\n[3] https://lczero.org/blog/2021/06/the-importance-of-open-data/\n[4] https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commit/e8d64af1\n[5] https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/\n[6] https://stockfishchess.org/get-involved/\n",

      "message": "Detect fortresses a little bit quicker\n\nIn the so-called \"hybrid\" method of evaluation of current master, we use the\nclassical eval (because of its speed) instead of the NNUE eval when the classical\nmaterial balance approximation hints that the position is \"winning enough\" to\nrely on the classical eval.\n\nThis trade-off idea between speed and accuracy works well in general, but in\nsome fortress positions the classical eval is just bad. So in shuffling branches\nof the search tree, we (slowly) increase the thresehold so that eventually we\ndon't trust classical anymore and switch to NNUE evaluation.\n\nThis patch increases that threshold faster, so that we switch to NNUE quicker\nin shuffling branches. Idea is to incite Stockfish to spend less time in fortresses\nlines in the search tree, and spend more time searching the critical lines.\n\npassed STC:\nLLR: 2.96 (-2.94,2.94) <-0.50,2.50>\nTotal: 47872 W: 3908 L: 3720 D: 40244\nPtnml(0-2): 122, 3053, 17419, 3199, 143\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/60cef34b457376eb8bcab79d\n\npassed LTC:\nLLR: 2.93 (-2.94,2.94) <0.50,3.50>\nTotal: 73616 W: 2326 L: 2143 D: 69147\nPtnml(0-2): 21, 1940, 32705, 2119, 23\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/60cf6d842114332881e73528\n\nRetested at LTC against lastest master:\nLLR: 2.93 (-2.94,2.94) <0.50,3.50>\nTotal: 18264 W: 642 L: 532 D: 17090\nPtnml(0-2): 6, 479, 8055, 583, 9\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/60d18cd540925195e7a6c351\n\ncloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/3578\n\nBench: 5139233\n",

More precisely,\nwe shuffled T60 and T74 data kindly provided by borg (for different Tnn, the data is\na result of Leela selfplay with differently sized Leela nets).\n\nThe data is available at vondele's google drive:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mftuzYdl9o6tBaceR3d_VBQIrgKJsFpl.\n\nThe Leela data comes in small chunks of .binpack files. To shuffle them, we simply\nused a small python script to randomly rename the files, and then concatenated them\nusing `cat`. As validation data we picked a file of T60 data. We will further investigate\nT74 data.\n\nThe training for the NNUE architecture used 200 epochs with the Python trainer from\nthe Stockfish project. Unlike the previous run we tried with this data, this run does\nnot have adjusted scaling — not because we didn't want to, but because we forgot.\nHowever, this training randomly skips 40% more positions than previous run. The loss\nwas very spiky and decreased slower than it does usually.\n\nTraining loss: https://github.com/official-stockfish/images/blob/main/training-loss-8e47cf062333.png\nValidation loss: https://github.com/official-stockfish/images/blob/main/validation-loss-8e47cf062333.png\n\nThis is the exact training command:\npython train.py --smart-fen-skipping --random-fen-skipping 14 --batch-size 16384 --threads 4 --num-workers 4 --gpus 1 trainingdata\\training_data.binpack validationdata\\val.binpack\n\n---\n\n10k STC result:\nELO: 3.61 +-3.3 (95%) LOS: 98.4%\nTotal: 10000 W: 1241 L: 1137 D: 7622\nPtnml(0-2): 68, 841, 3086, 929, 76\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/60c67e50457376eb8bcaae70\n\n10k LTC result:\nELO: 2.71 +-2.4 (95%) LOS: 98.8%\nTotal: 10000 W: 659 L: 581 D: 8760\nPtnml(0-2): 22, 485, 3900, 579, 14\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/60c69deb457376eb8bcaae98\n\nPassed LTC:\nLLR: 2.93 (-2.94,2.94) <0.50,3.50>\nTotal: 9648 W: 685 L: 545 D: 8418\nPtnml(0-2): 22, 448, 3740, 596, 18\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/60c6d41c457376eb8bcaaecf\n\n---\n\ncloses https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/3550\n\nBench: 4877339\n",
